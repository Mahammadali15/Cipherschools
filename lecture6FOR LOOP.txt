FOR LOOP:

The C++ for loop is used to iterate a part of the program several times. If the number of iteration is fixed, it is recommended to use for loop than while or do-while loops.

The C++ for loop is same as C. We can initialize variable, check condition and increment/decrement value.

SYNTAX:

for(initialization; condition; incr/decr){    
//code to be executed    
}
